        <h1>Let us help you support dogs in the New York shelter system.</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Adopting or fostering a dog is a substantial commitment, and not one everybody can afford. But NYC shelter dogs still need our help!</p><br/>
        <p>Dog's Best Friend lets you browse real, local shelter dogs and donate anything you can spare in their name, giving them
        a better chance to find a permanent home. Payments are secure, and 100% of your donation goes directly to the animal shelter housing the dog you choose to support,
        and specifically in the dog's name.</p><br/>
        <p> The dogs featured on this site are real NY shelter dogs scraped from the <a href="https://www.nycacc.org/">Animal Care Centers of NYC</a> website.</p><br/>
