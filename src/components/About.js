        <h1>Let us help you support dogs in the New York shelter system.</h1>
        <br/>
        <p>Adopting or fostering a dog is a substantial commitment, and not one everybody can afford. But NYC shelter dogs still need our help!
        <strong>Dog's Best Friend</strong> lets you browse real, local shelter dogs and donate anything you can spare in their name, giving them
        a better chance to find a permament home. Payments are secure, and 100% of your donation goes directly to the animal shelter housing the dog you choose to support,
        and specifically in the dog's name.</p>
